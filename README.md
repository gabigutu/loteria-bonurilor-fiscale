--romanian-receipt-lottery (English)--
This repository contains the results of the Romanian Receipt Lottery (called "Loteria Bonurilor Fiscale") contests organised by the Romanian Ministry of Finance in machine-readable format.

## About
This repository was created to provide application developers the results of the contests organized by the Romanian Ministry of Finance in a machine-readable format to use in their software programs.

The repository will be constantly updated with the results of the new draws. As other formats will be considered relevant, they will be added to the repository.
Any suggestions are welcome.

In the following we detail the mechanism of the contests.

### Contests Mechanism
The Romanian Ministry of Finance organizes monthly and occasionally draws of receipts with prize consisting of money. Monthly draws take place at the middle of each month, with all receipts issued in the previous month being considered. Occasional withdrawals take place at irregular intervals (especially on holidays such as Easter or Christmas), and receipts issued over a longer period of time are considered (usually all receipts issued within the current year).
The results of each draw include a date (day, month, year) and an amount. Individuals holding receipts with these characteristics (the amount is converted to zero decimal places) can ask for claiming the prize.

#### Terms of Participation
Any person with Romanian citizenship can participate in the lottery. This can be done by accumulating receipts from merchants. If after publishing the results of a contest a person finds that she has a receipt that has both the same date and the same amount (rounded to zero decimal) with those of the extraction, the person will have to fill in an application for claiming the prize.
Only receipts with amounts between 1 and 999.99 lei participate in the contests.
